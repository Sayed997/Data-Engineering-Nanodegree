## Udacity Data Engineering NanoDegree Projects 

### Data Modeling with Postgres
Build an ETL pipeline using Python and SQL to create a relational database with [Postgres](https://github.com/Sayed997/Data-Engineering-Nanodegree/tree/master/Data%20Modelling%20with%20Postgres). The analytical database 
follows a star schema and contains a fact and dimension tables.

### Data Modeling with Apache Cassandra
Build an ETL pipeline using Python and SQL to create a NoSql database with [Apache Cassandra](https://github.com/Sayed997/Data-Engineering-Nanodegree/tree/master/Data%20Modelling%20with%20Apache%20Cassandra).

### Data Warehouse with AWS
Build an ETL pipeline for a cloud based [Data Warehouse](https://github.com/Sayed997/Data-Engineering-Nanodegree/tree/master/Data%20Warehouse) hosted on Amazon Redshift. Data is loaded 
from Amazon S3 to staging tables on Redshift, thereafter analytics tables are created from the staging tables using SQL and Python.

### Data Lakes with Spark
Working with Big Data: Process large datasets and create analytics tables using [Spark](https://github.com/Sayed997/Data-Engineering-Nanodegree/tree/master/Data%20Lake%20with%20Spark) and AWS.

### Data Pipelines with Apache Airflow
Build a production ready Data Pipeline and automate ETL processes by using [Apache Airflow](https://github.com/Sayed997/Data-Engineering-Nanodegree/tree/master/Data%20Pipeline%20with%20Airflow/airflow). Build a dynamic pipeline 
that can be scheduled, monitored and allow easy backfills.
